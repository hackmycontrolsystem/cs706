# It's not recommended to modify this file in-place, because it will be
# overwritten during package upgrades.  If you want to customize, the best
# way is to create a file "/etc/systemd/system/httpd.service",
# containing
#   .include /lib/systemd/system/httpd.service
#   ...make your changes here...

# For example, to pass additional options (for instance, -D definitions) to the
# httpd binary at startup, you need to create a file named
# "/etc/systemd/system/httpd.service" containing:
#	.include /lib/systemd/system/httpd.service
#	[Service]
#	Environment=OPTIONS=-DMY_DEFINE
