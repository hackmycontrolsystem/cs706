GDiff - A Graphical Call Graph Diff Visualizer
===============================================

This is a class project for class CS706 at University of Wisconsin, Madison with Prof. [Ben Liblit](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~liblit/).

Summary 
-------
GDiff is a tool that generates call graph diff of two software versions using modern interactive visualizations techniques D3 (Data-Driven Documents). GFlow takes as input two sets of software artifacts. The first artifact is a pair of software versions written in C language and the second artifact is the bug repository associated with the software. It processes and analyzes both the artifacts to produce a call graph that highlights the paths that were added/deleted between the two version releases. It will also associate paths within the generated call graph with the corresponding bug IDs.
